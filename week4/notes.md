. Python Basics (Must Know)

You MUST know these:

✔ Variables
✔ Data types (string, int, list, dict, tuple)
✔ Loops (for, while)
✔ If/else statements
✔ Functions
✔ Importing modules (import something)

If you miss these, Django will feel very hard.

🔥 2. Python OOP (You only need these basics)

Django uses classes everywhere, so learn:

✔ How to create a class
class Car:
    pass

✔ What is __init__
✔ What is self
✔ How to create object instances
✔ Basic inheritance
✔ Methods inside classes

You DO NOT need:
❌ multiple inheritance
❌ decorators (advanced)
❌ metaclasses
❌ abstract classes
❌ complex OOP patterns

🔥 3. Python Collections

You should know:

✔ lists
✔ dictionaries
✔ list/dict methods
✔ loops on collections

Django uses dictionaries a lot (ex: context in templates).

🔥 4. File handling (Optional but useful)

Basic open(), read and write.

🔥 5. Virtual environments

Very important for Django:

venv

pip install package

pip freeze

🔥 6. Understanding how web apps work (just basics)

Not Python, but necessary:

✔ What is a server
✔ What is a URL
✔ What is an HTTP request/response

Just basic understanding is enough.

🌱 The Good Path to Follow

Here is the correct learning order:

1. Python basics
2. Python OOP basics
3. Django basic structure
4. Build small projects (Todo app, blog)
5. Then learn authentication, models, APIs
